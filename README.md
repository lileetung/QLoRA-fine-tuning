# YouTube Music Comment Analysis and Fine-tuning with QLoRA

## Overview

This project is dedicated to building a unique dataset for music sentiment analysis by leveraging the vast repository of music content on YouTube. By employing web scraping techniques, we gather the most popular comments from YouTube music videos and pair them with the titles of the music pieces. This rich dataset forms the foundation for our subsequent objective: fine-tuning the Mistral-7b-Instruct model using the QLoRA methodology.

The aim is to refine the model's ability to understand and generate nuanced responses to music-related queries and comments. By integrating insights from real-world music discussions, we expect the fine-tuned model to offer enhanced relevance and depth in its interactions concerning music appreciation, critique, and general discourse.
